Workflow:
--------

- make all changes on master branch. You can type `make` to build and serve the static site on your localhost.

- when changes look good, checkout the `production` branch, and commit the changes to production

- when production is pushed, teamcity will pickup the checkin, and publish to https://kb.blockbridge.com automatically.


Spin up a webserver locally
---------------------------

Jekyll can theoretically serve the content directly.  However, YMMV with this process:

% bundle install
...
Installing nokogiri 1.8.5 with native extensions
...

% bundle exec jekyll serve
