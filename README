Workflow:
--------

- make all changes on master branch. You can type `make` to build and serve the static site on your localhost.

- when changes look good, checkout the `production` branch, and commit the changes to production

- when production is pushed, teamcity will pickup the checkin, and publish to https://kb.blockbridge.com automatically.
